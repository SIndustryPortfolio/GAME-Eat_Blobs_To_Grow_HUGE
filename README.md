# 🍴 Eat Blobs to Grow HUGE

**Eat Blobs to Grow HUGE** is a fast-paced **3D Agar.io-style Roblox game** where size is everything.  
Consume RNG-spawned food scattered across the map to grow larger, dominate other players, and become the biggest blob in the server.

Players are represented as **half-cut spheres**, giving the game a clean, readable, and low-poly visual identity that prioritizes performance and smooth gameplay.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Spawn as a small blob
- Eat randomly generated food to increase your size
- Grow large enough to **consume other players**
- Dominate the server by becoming the largest entity alive
- Unlock cosmetics and upgrades through gameplay or optional purchases

Simple to learn, competitive to master.
